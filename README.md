# Daily-NIST-CVEs
PowerShell script to lookup daily CVE updates in the NIST National Vulnerability Database and email to user(s)

## Overview
I wrote this script to automate the process of checking daily NIST CVEs added/updated in the National Vulnerability Database.

## Usage
Script can be run daily via a scheduled task to push emails to specific users/mailboxes.

`To/From/SmtpServer` fields need to be set in the script before use.
